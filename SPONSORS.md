# Sponsorship and Support

This document explains how sponsorship supports the **Axiom** project and what sponsors can reasonably expect in return.

Axiom is infrastructure software. It is maintained with a long-term horizon, conservative change management, and an emphasis on correctness over novelty. Sponsorship exists to make that stewardship sustainable.

## What Sponsorship Supports

Funding directly supports ongoing work that is essential but difficult to sustain through volunteer effort alone:

* Maintenance of on-disk formats and ZFS dataset invariants
* Dependency resolver correctness, performance, and security hardening
* Compatibility tracking across FreeBSD, ZFS, and toolchain changes
* Documentation, operator guidance, and example workflows
* Careful review of contributions and external integrations

This work is continuous and does not map cleanly to individual features or milestones.

## What Sponsorship Does *Not* Buy

To keep the project healthy and trustworthy, sponsorship does **not** imply:

* Exclusive features or private forks
* Priority access to unreleased code
* Influence over architectural direction without technical merit
* Guaranteed timelines for speculative features

Axiom is developed in the open. Core functionality remains equally available to all users.

## What Sponsors Can Expect

While no service-level agreements are implied, sponsors can reasonably expect:

* Sustained maintenance rather than best-effort availability
* Clear technical decision making and documentation of tradeoffs
* Conservative evolution with strong backward compatibility
* Responsiveness to well-scoped issues affecting real deployments
* A project that treats stability as a first-class goal

In short, sponsorship helps ensure that Axiom remains a dependable foundation rather than a stalled experiment.

## Appropriate Use Cases for Sponsorship

Sponsorship is particularly appropriate if you or your organization:

* Depend on Axiom for reproducible systems or environments
* Build tooling or distributions on top of Axiom
* Rely on its on-disk formats or resolver behavior
* Prefer funding maintenance over funding feature churn

If Axiom reduces operational risk for you, sponsorship helps keep that risk low.

---

## Consulting and Commercial Support

Some needs fall outside the scope of general sponsorship. For example:

* Deployment-specific design or review
* Custom integrations or workflows
* Architecture consultation for Axiom-based systems

These may be addressed separately through consulting or contractual support. Such arrangements do not affect the open development model.

## How to Sponsor

Sponsorship options are listed on the GitHub Sponsors page for this repository.

If you represent an organization and have questions about long-term support or alignment, please open an issue or contact the maintainer directly.

## Stewardship

Axiom is maintained with the assumption that systems outlive individuals and trends.

Sponsorship is not charity. It is a way to ensure that critical infrastructure continues to be maintained with care, restraint, and technical integrity.
